## Prompt:

Thanks for the suggestions. We might have already done this but I want us to revisit and get clear on it. I am still doing interview prep for I&M Bank and would like to take some notes that are clear to follow so that I can be must have candidate. Below are some guidelines that I want us to follow.

Here’s the truth:
👉 Hiring isn’t just about qualifications.
👉 It’s about how well you fit the company’s needs, culture, and long-term goals.

One of the biggest mistakes job seekers make is focusing only on their own story—what they’ve done, what they want—without stepping into the employer’s shoes.

But when you understand who is involved in the hiring process and what matters most to them, you can tailor your approach to show them exactly why you’re the perfect fit.

This is how you go from being just another qualified candidate to the one they feel excited to hire.

With that said, here is some action items or homework that I want us to do in order to Prepare to Be the Must-Have Candidate.
